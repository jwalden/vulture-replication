# vulture-replication
Replication study of the "Vulture" paper "Predicting Vulnerable Software Components" (CCS'07)

## Setup
This project makes use of Python 2.7, although Python 3.4+ should work as well. You can either use Anaconda or set up a virtual environment.

### Using virtualenv
1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```
virtualenv venv
source  venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install all the dependencies in the virtual environment:
```
pip install -e .
```

### Using Anaconda
Anaconda is a Python distribution with most if not all of the required modules preinstalled. You can find it on `https://www.continuum.io`.
